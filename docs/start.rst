Getting Started
---------------

To complete the steps in this guide, you will need the following programs:

- A web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- A command line program.
- A text editor like Notepad or TextEdit.
 
These programs should already be on your computer. If you are on a Mac, your command line will be called Terminal. If you are on a Windows PC, it will be called Command Prompt.

*Note: Terminal and Command Prompt are both extremely powerful tools. Do NOT run a command unless you know what it does first.*

If you are using Windows, skip the next section and go to the Installing Scrapy: Windows section. If you are working on a Mac, continue to the following section.
